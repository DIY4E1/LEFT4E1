# LEFT4E1
The alphabet systems, font family and runicons presented here serves as an incentive to learn and internalize the Leporellion as an encryption method. You can negotiate an intercultural consensus on complex issues and use so-called aggregates, glyphs (e.g. SMOL runicons, SMOL runicodes), prefixes and suffixes instead of a conventional alphabet - to which the sender and receiver had previously agreed.
Even if not all words can be visualized or shrunk, you can minimize the number of characters. You can encrypt without falsifying the meaning. Initially, you only write or transform your mother tongue into the Leporellion.
How to expand the vocabulary and use it for situational parlance, you learn in more chapters, but at a later date. In the end, you will notice that you compose more and write less!
You will recognize that you translate and encode texts into Leporellion and with LEFT4E1 without distorting their original version. You reveal complex issues because you help pack fragile words by using 'compiled' workspace and 'optimizable' workflow.
The reproduction will only show its true character (face) after the translation. Also, what is hidden behind the columns, can be encrypted with the further development of LEFT4E1.
