The alphabet presented here serves as an incentive to learn and internalize the Leporellion in Visual Braille. Only later you can negotiate an intercultural consensus on complex issues and use so-called aggregates, glyphs, prefixes and suffixes instead of a conventional alphabet - to which the sender and receiver had previously agreed.
Even if not all words can be visualized or shrunk, you can minimize the number of characters. You can encrypt without falsifying the meaning. Initially, you only write or transform your mother tongue into the Leporellion in Visual Braille.
In the end, you will notice that you compose more and write less!
You will recognize that you translate texts into Leporellion Visual Braille without distorting their original version. You reveal complex issues because you help pack fragile words.
The reproduction will only show its true face after the translation. Also, what is hidden behind the columns, can be encrypted with the Grammar of the Leporellion Visual Braille.The alphabet presented here serves as an incentive to learn and internalize the Leporellion in Visual Braille.
